# League_of_Legends_RF_Classifier
This is a League of Legends Random Forest classifier that takes pre match data in and predicts which team will win

I used Ranked Game prematch data ranging from Iron to Diamond to predict the winner of a given match using data such as matchups, champion selections, mastery, and win rates. It also includes some feature engineering including Skewness, Kurtosis, and Variance

2 data sets were used, Latin America North (LAN) and North America (NA)
